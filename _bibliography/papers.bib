  ABSTRACT = {Over time the concept of hypercyclicity has been explored in different manners and contexts, gaining new forms and applications. In particular when the spacehas an adjacent structure, we can always look for sets of hypercyclic vectors compatible with that framework. In this paper we deal with hypercyclic operators acting on Fréchet sequence algebras and give criteria for the existence of common and disjoint hypercyclic algebras.},

In this paper we give new criteria and characterisations in the context of convolution operators acting on \(H(\Bbb C)\) &#x0; and backward shifts acting on a general Fréchet sequence algebra. Analogous questions arise for stronger properties like frequent hypercyclicity. In this trend we give a sufficient condition for a weighted backward shift to admit an upper frequently hypercyclic algebra and we find a weighted backward shift acting on \(c_0\) &#x0; admitting a frequently hypercyclic algebra for the coordinatewise product. The closed hypercyclic algebra problem is also covered.},

       abstract = {The Bohnenblust–Hille inequality for \(m\)-linear forms was proven in 1931 as a generalization of the famous \(4/3\)-Littlewood inequality. The optimal constants (or at least their asymptotic behavior as \(m\) grows) is unknown, but significant for applications. A recent result, obtained by Cavalcante, Teixeira and Pellegrino, provides a kind of algorithm, composed by finitely many elementary steps, giving as the final outcome the optimal truncated Bohnenblust–Hille constants of any order. But the procedure of Cavalcante et al. has a fairly large number of calculations and computer assistance cannot be avoided. In this paper we present a computational solution to the problem, using the Wolfram Language. We also use this approach to investigate a conjecture raised by Pellegrino and Teixeira, asserting that \(C_m=2^1\)\(^−\)\(^1\)\(^/\)\(^m\) &#x0; for all \(m\in \Bbb N\) &#x0; and to reveal interesting unknown facts about the geometry of the closed unit ball in the space \(L(^3\Bbb R^3)\).},
