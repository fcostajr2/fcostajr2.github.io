This is the small town I was born in. But I've lived in there for no more than a couple of days ! At that time my family had a peculiar tradition : every childbirth was made by my À l'époque ma famille avait une tradition : tous les accouchements étaient faits par mon uncle and obstetrician Dr. Wilson Vieira Costa, his clinic is located in this small town, 45km away from my parents house. In this picture one can see the Goiti's Christ, a kind of "mini Christ the Redeemer" statue.

## High School

- January 2009 - December 2011

My High School took place at my parents town Arapiraca in the state of Alagoas, in the Quintella Cavalcanti School (EQC). I had a very good mathematics professor, the very kind Roberto Da Silva.

## Lic.

- January 2012 - December 2015

The initial idea of my project was to study Lebesgue integral in advance, but while researching the story behind this integral and the general theory of integration, I found a lot of notions of integration, which improved more and more our capacity of integrating. I ended up by exploring this vast univers of integration types and their chronological interrelations. In the final project we include many historical informations while developing the theory, goins from Newton and Leibniz, passing through Cauchy and Riemann, Lebesgue and Riesz, and arriving at Henstock, Kurzweil, MacShane and others. This project was supervised by Ornan Philipe, who is, teaching-wise, one of the best professors I have ever met. My studies took place at the Federal University of Alagoas, Campus Arapiraca.

## M.Sc.

- July 2016 - February 2018

During my master I had the lucky chance of working with Daniel Pellegrino on the Bohnenblust-Hille inequality (among others). I had to learn to code in Mathematica in order to implement an algorithm which finds the extreme points of the unitary ball on the space of multilinear forms acting on the Euclidean space. My Master took place at the Mathematics Department of the University of Paraíba (DM-UFPB).

## Ph.D.

- June 2018 - May 2021

The subject of my thesis is the theory of Linear Dynamical Systems, specially on the concept of hypercyclicity and related topics. What mainly interested us were the algebras of hypercyclic vectors on a Fréchet sequence algebra. The adaptations of Baire criteria for vectors to the algebraic context have given us lots of material to work on, what lead to a significant increase in our understanding of this topic.

I had the opportunity to have Frédéric Bayart as my thesis advisor, which took place in the city of Clermont-Ferrand, at the Blaise Pascal Mathematics Laboratory (LMBP) of the Clermont Auvergne University.
