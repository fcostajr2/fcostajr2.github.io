Hi! I'm Fernando Vieira Costa Júnior, a Mathematician from Brazil :smile:

Formed with focus on Analysis, I have a particular sympathy for Algebra, Number Theory and Logic. Teaching for me is a passion ! In this page I talk a bit about myself and about my job. My students will find here support material for my courses.

My main research interest is that of Linear Dynamics and Operator Theory. I am also interested in the implementation of mathematical algorithms on Mathematica and Python.

At the moment I am a FNRS postdoctoral researcher at the Mathematics Department of the University of Mons.

You can contact me through the email <a href="mailto:fernando.vieiracostajunior@umons.ac.be"><i>fernando.vieiracostajunior@umons.ac.be</i></a>, although, shall you need a quick response, it is best to write to my personal email <it>fv [dot] costajunior [at] gmail [dot] com</it>.
